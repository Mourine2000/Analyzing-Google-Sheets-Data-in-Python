# Analyzing-Google-Sheets-Data-in-Python
Here, I use Python and a little bit of SQL to analyze google sheets data.
## Divided into 6 tasks:
* Importing the data stored in Google Drive using SQL. The #DataCamp platform provides a managable format to do this where you can just connect to your drive and import the data.
* Moving to Python, import the neccessary packages; Pandas and Plotly.
* Cleaning the Dataframe. The column with time date was converted to a datetime object.
* EDA- Exploring the dataset using visualization tool from pandas and plotly.
* More EDA to analyze the sessions according to time.
* Answers the question, which channel leads to most transactons per session.
